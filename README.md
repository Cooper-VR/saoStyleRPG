# SAO style RPG

## Description
This is a VR game meant to be a sort of demo of what I think SAO would be like. It has 11-point FTB and mostly from the ground up input.
This does NOT have controls for quest. I do not own one so I've only focused on Index. Some funcitons might work but they are untested
<br>-currently working on branch "enemyV2"
