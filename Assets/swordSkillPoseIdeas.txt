Locations/QuadrentBased(reletive to hmd):
	pros:
		easier to implement
		easy for the user to do
	cons:
		not very scalable

location + rotation(reletve to hmd + floor)
	pros:
		more skills
		bigger learning curve
		more options
	cons:
		harder learning curve
		harder to implement


sword hand rotation can be checked with a second collider at the end of the sword that would move to different quadrents

to get poses:
	prefered, make a editor script:
		on button press wait 5 sec
		after 5 sec, get the colliding quaderents for the hands and the end of the sword
		create a new scriptable object that that has three values for the hands and sword
		assign the values to the quadrents hit, could use string name, or int, or enums
		the user would then have a certain onces base on the level
		
		to check if they are doing it, loop through an array of their poses and check of any match

		this same recording technich could be applied to the combos aswell using a dummy and the directions
